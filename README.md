# [Memory Game](https://udacity-memory-game.surge.sh/)

This is a memory game made using vanilla JS as part of my course work for the Front-End Nanodegree from Udacity.

### How to Run the game:
Either visit [this page](https://udacity-memory-game.surge.sh/), or clone the repository/download the zip to run the game locally in your browser of choice.

### How to play:
To play, click on a card and try to select its match by clicking on another card. The game will track your time and guesses and assign you a star rating based on your total number of guesses. You've won the game once every pair has been matched.

### Features:
- Unique animations for each matching pair
- A restart button if you are not happy with your performance and would like to try again

### Dependencies:
